      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Our history at Nomad Medical Group is rooted in the remarkable synergy
        of healthcare professionals and visionary business leaders who share an
        unwavering passion for adventure, travel and a profound commitment
        to improving the world through creative innovation and compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey began when a group of dedicated healthcare workers came
        together with business leaders who understood the transformative
        potential of blending adventure, travel and healthcare.
        Driven by a common purpose, our founders embarked on a mission to
        pioneer a new approach to healthcare that transcended geographical
        boundaries and brought healing to those who needed it most.

      <p>
        Through years of dedication and hard work, we've created a legacy of
        democratising access to world‑class healthcare services, even at the
        far reaches of the planet. Our history is
        a testament to the power of collaboration, adventure and the
        unwavering belief that together we can make the world a better
        place—one patient, one traveller and one innovative healthcare
        solution at a time.

          <h3>Ryan Gillum, MD</h3>
          <!-- Updated biography text for Ryan Gillum, MD -->
          <p>
            Ryan Gillum, MD is the founder and CEO of Nomad Medical, where he
            leads with a deep commitment to expanding innovative, compassionate
            and advanced care to underserved, marginalised and rural
            communities. Guided by the belief that cutting-edge technology
            should serve those most often overlooked, he works to bridge
            healthcare gaps through modern, mobile solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before pursuing medicine, Dr. Gillum studied anthropology in the
            Pacific Islands and Central America—formative experiences that
            continue to shape his culturally attuned, human‑centred
            approach to care. He is board certified by the American Board of
            Family Medicine and currently practices as a hospitalist at the
            highest‑altitude Level&nbsp;III trauma centre in North America,
            located at 9,100 feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Gillum was awarded the Justina Ford Humanism Award, an honour
            presented annually to the third‑year family medicine resident who
            exemplifies exceptional dedication to humanistic principles in
            healthcare. This recognition reflects his steadfast commitment to
            compassionate care, ethical practice and community service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of medicine, Dr. Gillum is an avid mountaineer,
            whitewater enthusiast and fly fisherman. He finds his greatest joy
            in exploring wild places and spending time with his family.
